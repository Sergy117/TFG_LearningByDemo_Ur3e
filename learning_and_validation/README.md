Having all the vision process finished, for apply learning by demostration, it is used dmps, for describing the trayectory learned in the robot world.
With te demostrations datased recorded by the main vision script, the script learn_dmp.py generates a dmps to be reproduced by the UR3e Robot.
The validate_compare kinematic mapping is used to visualize the differences between the human demostration to the robot reproducing the demo.
